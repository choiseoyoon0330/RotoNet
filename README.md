# RotoNet: Rotoscoping-Based Artistic Style Transfer Networks
> **Abstract:** RotoNet is a novel deep learning framework specifically designed for automated rotoscoping-based artistic style transfer in videos. Unlike conventional video style transfer approaches that focus on general stylization, RotoNet captures the distinctive aesthetic qualities of rotoscoping animation-precision in motion tracing, line expressiveness, and artistic interpretation of human movement.
